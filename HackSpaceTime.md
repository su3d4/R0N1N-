We are developing a set of temporal and spatial Haskell libraries, dubbed HaskTimeSpace, is a project that can have significant implications for various domains, including physics, biology, and computer science. Here's a high-level outline to get you started:

**I. Temporal Libraries (HaskTime)**

1. **Time Representation**: Define a `Time` data type to represent temporal values, which could be based on existing Haskell libraries like `time` or
`chronos`. Consider using a robust and efficient representation, such as a 64-bit integer for seconds since the Unix epoch.
2. **Temporal Operations**: Implement functions for performing arithmetic operations on `Time` values, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. These operations should take into account temporal constraints, like ensuring that time doesn't go backward.
3. **Temporal Intervals**: Introduce a `TimeInterval` data type to represent intervals of time, which can be used to model durations, periods, or
schedules. Implement functions for creating, manipulating, and querying these intervals.
4. **Temporal Queries**: Provide functions for querying temporal relationships between `Time` values or `TimeInterval`s, such as determining whether two
intervals overlap, are contiguous, or have a specific temporal relationship (e.g., "during," "starts," "ends").
5. **Causal Relationships**: Implement support for modeling causal relationships between events in time, which can be essential for applications like
causality analysis or event-driven systems.

**II. Spatial Libraries (HaskSpace)**

1. **Spatial Data Types**: Define a set of spatial data types, such as `Point`, `Vector`, `Line`, `Polygon`, and `Geometry`, to represent various
geometric objects in 2D or 3D space.
2. **Geometric Operations**: Implement functions for performing geometric operations on these spatial data types, including calculations like distance,
angle, intersection, union, and difference.
3. **Spatial Queries**: Provide functions for querying spatial relationships between geometric objects, such as determining whether two shapes intersect,
are adjacent, or have a specific spatial relationship (e.g., "inside," "outside," "touches").
4. **Coordinate Systems**: Support various coordinate systems, including Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates, to accommodate different use
cases.
5. **Spatial Indexing**: Implement efficient indexing mechanisms, such as spatial trees (e.g., R-trees, quad trees) or grids, to enable fast querying of
large spatial datasets.

**III. Integration and Additional Features**

1. **Temporal-Spatial Integration**: Develop a set of functions that integrate temporal and spatial operations, enabling the manipulation of
spatiotemporal data structures, such as trajectories or events with spatial and temporal components.
2. **Visualization**: Provide tools for visualizing temporal and spatial data, including 2D and 3D plotting capabilities, to facilitate exploration and
understanding of complex datasets.
3. **Data Import/Export**: Implement support for importing and exporting temporal and spatial data from various formats, such as CSV, GeoJSON, or
Shapefiles.
4. **Error Handling and Validation**: Ensure robust error handling and validation mechanisms are in place to prevent errors and inconsistencies in the
libraries.

**IV. Development Roadmap**

1. **Initial Release**: Focus on implementing a core set of temporal and spatial libraries with basic functionality.
2. **Expansion and Refining**: Gradually add more advanced features, optimize performance, and refine the APIs based on user feedback.
3. **Use Case Driven Development**: Develop HaskTimeSpace in tandem with real-world applications or use cases to ensure the libraries meet practical
requirements.

By following this outline, you can create a comprehensive set of temporal and spatial Haskell libraries that will enable researchers and developers to
efficiently work with complex spatiotemporal data structures.

```haskell
-- HaskTimeSpace.hs

{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}
{-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}

module HaskTimeSpace where

import Data.Kind (Type)
import GHC.TypeLits (Nat)

-- **Temporal Library (HaskTime)**

data Time :: Nat -> Type where
  MkTime :: Integer -> Time n

instance Eq (Time n) where
  (==) = (==) `on` getTime

getTime :: Time n -> Integer
getTime (MkTime t) = t

-- Temporal operations

addTime :: Time n -> Time m -> Time (n + m)
addTime (MkTime t1) (MkTime t2) = MkTime (t1 + t2)

subTime :: Time n -> Time m -> Time (n - m)
subTime (MkTime t1) (MkTime t2) = MkTime (t1 - t2)

-- **Spatial Library (HaskSpace)**

data Point :: Type where
  MkPoint :: Double -> Double -> Point

instance Eq Point where
  (==) = (==) `on` getX &&& (==) `on` getY

getX :: Point -> Double
getX (MkPoint x _) = x

getY :: Point -> Double
getY (MkPoint _ y) = y

-- Spatial operations

distance :: Point -> Point -> Double
distance p1 p2 = sqrt ((getX p1 - getX p2) ^ 2 + (getY p1 - getY p2) ^ 2)

-- **Temporal-Spatial Integration**

data Trajectory :: Nat -> Type where
  MkTrajectory :: [Time n] -> [Point] -> Trajectory n

instance Functor Trajectory where
  fmap f (MkTrajectory ts ps) = MkTrajectory ts (map f ps)

-- Initializers

zeroTime :: Time 0
zeroTime = MkTime 0

origin :: Point
origin = MkPoint 0.0 0.0

exampleTrajectory :: Trajectory 3
exampleTrajectory =
  MkTrajectory [MkTime 1, MkTime 2, MkTime 3]
             [MkPoint 1.0 2.0, MkPoint 3.0 4.0, MkPoint 5.0 6.0]

-- This is just an initial iteration, and there's much more to be added,
-- refined, and optimized.
```
This code defines the basic data types for temporal (`Time`) and spatial (`Point`) values, as well as a `Trajectory` data type that combines both. It
also provides some initial operations and instances for these types.

Note that this is just a starting point, and there are many ways to improve and extend this code. Some potential next steps could include:

* Adding more advanced temporal operations (e.g., interval arithmetic)
* Implementing spatial indexing and querying mechanisms
* Providing support for additional spatial data types (e.g., `Line`, `Polygon`)
* Developing a more robust and efficient implementation of the `Trajectory` data type
* Creating a visualization framework for temporal-spatial data
